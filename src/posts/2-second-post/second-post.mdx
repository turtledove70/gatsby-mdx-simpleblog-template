# Vibing to Vaporwave


Channel Select is one of my favorite vaporwave artists.  The two previous 
releases from this artists I was able to obtain though chance from another friendly 
user over at the discogs site.  The chances of ever me repeating that
type of trade with another collector and the way it worked out
are like slim to none.  That being said, there's just a plethora
of vaporwave artists out there that I don't have time to see a 
who's who from the genre.  I usually get good references from Twitter
or Bandcamp's site.  However, I'm very picky in this genre.  Smooth
jazz and slowed down '80s music or commercials (e.g. signalwave) from that era always
brings nostalgic feelings from me, which I can very much relate to when it comes
to seeking albums from this genre.  Nonetheless,
I consider this artist to be among my top vaporwave artist.  Speaking of
vaporwave music, $1000 for a tape is just a tad too much, but then
again, I wouldn't sell my original copy of 'Eccojams' for anything.
Period!!

I read the other day from someone's tweet from Twitter about this album being  
tunes from VHS cassettes.  I don't see how that reference can be thougt up, but 
the feel good vibes are apparent from listening to this album.  The music
is refreshing and could probably be played with repeated listens
to over and over without getting tired of it.  This is the music I like to play
while going out and about doing various ativities.  These type of interludes while 
traveling is just how I want it.  I have no idea when I will ever get tired of 
playing this album and just forget about it.  Tunes that won't get old.
