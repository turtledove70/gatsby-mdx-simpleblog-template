# Vinyl Vault's Archive - September 2021

Though fall season hasn't yet been officially set date, its still
very warm and dry weather being that summer hasn't gone away.  Halloween is just around the corner, where the main theme for 
the upcoming holidays is spooky treats and I can't think of a better
time of the season to play death metal than trick or treat day.  And 
that's what this week's post will cover.  Talk about heavy and raw,
this obscure band are from Mjolby, Sweden and were active in the 
underground death metal scene since the early '90s.  Since I don't have
the time to seek out these guy's early demos, let alone pay collector's 
costs for original demos, which I really don't care much for, other 
than their EPs, this album culls Traumatic's early material and puts it all
on this album among other treats for the fans.  As a warning, this 
music is not for the faint of heart...

Old-school death metal is what I hear coming out of my mini-desktop
computer speakers.  Of course, this release is a compilation of 
Traumatic's two early demo cassettes, the 7" EP, and compilation tracks.
Also, included are two 11"x 17" (A3) posters and a booklet that features the
band's history, some rare photographs, and other liner notes from their
archives.  My copy is on bone-white colored vinyl that's limited to only
100 copies.  There's also a red / silver colored edition besides the black
 edition that's limited to 300/200 copies respectively.  I ordered this from Generation Records online store
and this item wasn't even advertised as being colored vinyl; but, heck, I'm
not complaining.  Not that I'm an expert in early death metal stuff,
but the metal here is nothing but sheer raw sounds, and by that, I mean brashing cymbals, with buzzsaw
guirars and gruff guttural vocals, that just happens to be very typical of this genre. 
Furthermore, these guys aren't that very popular of a band than compared to
Bolth Thrower or Entombed, and would be easily 
classified as underground metal.  This Swedish death metal album is
destined for my archives and comes very highly recommended.
