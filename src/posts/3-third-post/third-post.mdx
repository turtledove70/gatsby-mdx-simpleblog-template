# Modern Sounding Tribal Beats

Today's post is about the mighty Zoviet France; in particular, their 
album "Digilogue".  I've been a fan of these guys since my first
tape release I bought from them from the Soleilmoon records mail order
when they used to advertise their catalog not online, but on leaflets or 
mail-order sheets.  "Lohland" had me, and I've never strayed much from 
wanting to reamin a fan of experimental music.  I couldn't compare these
guys to anything from the radio, so I ventured further and then got into
Muslimgauze.  But this post will stick to the "Digilogue" album, and here is
my review.

Zoviet France are is enigmatic group, in my humble opinion.  Their earliest
recordings I would go through lengths to try and obtain copies of.  What
sticks with their output is that ghostly sound that ebbs throughout the tracks.  They craft this
so well into their music.  And their earliest cassettes I find this to be
so prevalent.  I have most of their early recordings, and still would like
to own an original of their "Popular Soviet Songs.." release on cassette, even though
I have the reissued CD version of that album.
